# LeorumaPong
Pong game by Leonardo, Rúben and Mario A. from the 36th boot camp of <Academia de Código_>.
 
It was developed in the context of a code challenge during the first part of the boot camp. We learned a lot while programming this little game. We can now appreciate how long we've come since then...
 
Try it out for yourself: you can find the .jar file in the "build" directory. Have fun!
